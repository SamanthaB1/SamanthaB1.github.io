Computing Will Change Society 





Lightbot: Differences and Similarites to Computers





Computing may change society but it might not be a change for the better. Nothing you put on the internet is ever private no matter what you think and it may have repercussions beyond what you expected. Anything you try to delete is never truely deleted, meaning your mistakes are forever. People belive that encryption is one hundred percent safe when it is not, not even a little bit. Somoene who really wants to get your information and is motivated will eventurally break thru your defences. People like the RIAA can see eerything you are doing. Even though their method is flawed the RIAA uses it to track anyone that is, or might be, illegally downloading music from the internet. Even if you're not the person who commited the illegal download they will still demand money from you for restitiution. 



Lightbot shares many, but not all, qualities with computers thru programming. You have to program lightbt's inputs and outputs just like a computer, however computers think for themselves where lightbot cannot.

1. It is a better idea to program in small pieces instead of trying to put it all in at once because it will be easier to find any mistakes that are made. 

2. Math is similar to professional programming in many ways. In both programming and math, if you complete the task or problem all at once and the answer is wrong then you have to go searching through you work inorder to find what went wrong.

4. Using a dual or quad core processor means you can run more tasks or actions without dragging the system down. So for example you could have a spreadsheet that allows someone to input numbers into many columns and by doing so another action occurs like moving the numbers to another sheet or adding up rows and columns. All the individual steps happen in order yet hapen so fast it seems like it's all at once. 





Here you can see videos of performances and learn more about my involvement with the team.

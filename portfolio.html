		<h3>"Computing will change society."</h3>
		<p> Computing may change society but it might not be in the best ways that it can.
		Nothing you put on the internet is ever private no matter what you think.  Anything
		you try to delete is never truely deleted.  People belive that encryption is one 
		hundred percent save when it is not, not even a little bit.  People like the RIAA
		can see eerything you are doing.  The RIAA uses a flawed method to find anybody
		that is or might be illegally downloading music from the internet.  A lot of the time
		they don't find the right but still demand the money from who they did find, even if 
		they are innocent.</p>

	 	<h3>Scratch Answers</h3>
	  <p>1. It is a better idea to program in small pieces instead of trying to put it 
	  all in at once because it will be easier to find any mistakes that are made.
	  <p>2. Math is similar to professional programming in many ways.  In both programming 
	  and math, if you complete the task or problem all at once and the answer is wrong then 
	  you have to go searching through you work inorder to find what went wrong.</p>
	  <p>4. Using a dual or quad core processor means you can run more tasks or actions without dragging the system down.  So for example you could 
	  have a spreadsheet that allows someone to input numbers into many columns and by doing so another action occurs like moving the numbers to another
	  sheet or adding up rows and columns.  all the individual steps happen in order yet hapen so fast it seems like it's all at once.    </p>

    <h2>"Computing will change society."</h2>
	<br>
	<p>Computing may change society but it might not be in the best ways that it can.</p>
	<p>Nothing you put on the internet is ever private no matter what you think.  Anything</p>
	<p>you try to delete is never truely deleted.  People belive that encryption is one</p> 
	<p>hundred percent save when it is not, not even a little bit.  People like the RIAA</p>
	<p>can see eerything you are doing.  The RIAA uses a flawed method to find anybody</p>
	<p>that is or might be illegally downloading music from the internet.  A lot of the time </p>
	<p>they don't find the right but still demand the money from who they did find, even if </p>
	<p>they are innocent.</p>

		<h1>"Computing will change society."</h1>
		<p> Computing may change society but it might not be in the best ways that it can.
		Nothing you put on the internet is ever private no matter what you think.  Anything<
		you try to delete is never truely deleted.  People belive that encryption is one 
		hundred percent save when it is not, not even a little bit.  People like the RIAA
		can see eerything you are doing.  The RIAA uses a flawed method to find anybody
		that is or might be illegally downloading music from the internet.  A lot of the time
		they don't find the right but still demand the money from who they did find, even if 
		they are innocent.</p>
